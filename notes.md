# Mario 

## Don't Code Mario In The Sandbox 

We are transitioning to coding in the IDE located at https://cs50.io

In the IDE environment you will create your code and run it in a directory that you will create. 
The path to the location will be ~workspace/unit1/mario

To setup the directory do the following:

* Open another browser window (shortcut command + n)
* Navigate to https://cs50.io and login
* cd to unit1
* mkdir mario and then cd into mario
* create a new file called mario.c located in the mario directory
* open mario.c in your IDE code editor window
* With the Step by Step instructions open next to your new window create your code
* Remember in the IDE you need to save ( command + s ) your work before you compile it

Happy Coding!
