### Don't Code ISBN In The Sandbox Environment

It is time to transition to coding in the IDE located at https//:cs50.io

The Sandbox has been a nice initial coding environment, but it has been a little buggy, and
it does not allow you retain your files in an organized hierarchy.

For the ISBN problem do the following:

  * Use the step by step instructions located at the left
  * Open another browser window (shortcut command + n)
  * Navigate to https//:cs50.io and login
  * cd to unit1/ 
  * mkdir isbn and then cd into isbn/
  * create a new file called isbn.c located in the isbn/ directory
  * open isbn.c in your IDE code editor window
  * With the Step by Step instructions open next your new window create your isbn source code
  * Remember in the IDE you need to save (shortcut command + s) your work before you compile it
  * Happy Coding!
